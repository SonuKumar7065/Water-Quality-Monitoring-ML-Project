🌍 Water Quality Monitoring – ML Internship Project

This repository contains my work for the Edunet AI/ML Internship Project (2025) on Water Quality Monitoring & Pollution Control. The aim is to analyze water quality parameters and build ML models to predict whether water is safe (Potable = 1) or unsafe (Potable = 0) for human consumption.

✅ Week 1 – Data Understanding

Imported dataset water_potability.csv

Checked dataset shape (rows × columns)

Performed .head(), .info(), .describe()

Checked for missing values (.isnull().sum())

Saved cleaned dataset for next week’s tasks

🚀 How to Run

Open Google Colab

Upload the notebook: notebooks/Week1_Water_Quality.ipynb

Upload the dataset: dataset/water_potability.csv

Run all cells step by step

📊 Dataset Info

Rows: 3276

Columns: 10

Target Column: Potability (0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe)

🔮 Next Steps (Week 2 Preview)

Handle missing values & clean dataset

Perform detailed EDA with plots (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap)

Prepare data for model training
