# Water Quality Monitoring - AI/ML Internship Project

This repository contains my work for the Edunet AI/ML Internship Project on **Water Quality Monitoring**.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `dataset/` â†’ contains water_potability.csv dataset  
- `notebooks/` â†’ contains Colab notebooks  
- `README.md` â†’ project documentation  
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python dependencies  

## âœ… Week 1 Task
- Imported required Python libraries.
- Imported dataset `water_potability.csv`
- Performed data exploration (info, head, describe, missing values, shape)
- Checked dataset shape (rows Ã— columns)
- Saved cleaned dataset for next weekâ€™s tasks

## âœ… Week 2 Task â€“ Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handled missing values in ph, Sulfate, and Trihalomethanes using mean imputation.
- Removed duplicate rows to ensure dataset integrity.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations:
- Histograms for feature distributions
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Correlation heatmap to check feature relationships
- Count plot for Potable vs Non-Potable distribution
- Comparative boxplots (e.g., pH vs Potability, Hardness vs Potability)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload the notebook from `notebooks/Week1_Water_Quality.ipynb`
3. Run all cells
