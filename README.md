# Water Quality Monitoring - AI/ML Internship Project

This repository contains my work for the Edunet AI/ML Internship Project on **Water Quality Monitoring**.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `dataset/` â†’ contains water_potability.csv dataset  
- `notebooks/` â†’ contains Colab notebooks  
- `README.md` â†’ project documentation  
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python dependencies  

## âœ… Week 1 Task â€“ Data Loading & Initial Exploration
- Imported required Python libraries.
- Imported dataset `water_potability.csv`
- Performed data exploration (info, head, describe, missing values, shape)
- Checked dataset shape (rows Ã— columns)
- Performed basic exploration:
  - .info() â†’ dataset structure
  - .describe() â†’ statistical summary
  - .isnull().sum() â†’ checked missing values
- Saved notebook as Week1_Water_Quality.ipynb

## âœ… Week 2: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  

During Week 2, the focus was on **cleaning and preparing the dataset** for machine learning.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Steps
- Handled **missing values** in critical features:  
  - `ph` â†’ filled using mean imputation  
  - `Sulfate` â†’ filled using mean imputation  
  - `Trihalomethanes` â†’ filled using mean imputation  
- Removed **duplicate records** to ensure dataset quality  
- Converted dataset into a **clean and analysis-ready version**  

### ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated **summary statistics** (`.describe()`)  
- Created **distribution plots** (histograms, boxplots)  
  ![Distribution of Features](images/distribution.png)  

- Used a **heatmap correlation matrix** to identify relationships between features  
  ![Correlation Heatmap](images/heatmap.png)  

### ðŸ”¹ Output
- Saved cleaned dataset as:  
  - ðŸ“‚ `dataset/cleaned_water_potability.csv`  

### ðŸ”¹ Insights
- Significant missing values were present initially, especially in `ph`, `Sulfate`, and `Trihalomethanes`.  
- Correlation analysis showed moderate relationships between some features.  
- Dataset imbalance was observed (`Potability = 0` has more samples than `Potability = 1`).  


## âœ… Week 3: Machine Learning Models
- Built classification models to predict **water potability**  

### ðŸ“Š Models Implemented
1. **Logistic Regression** â†’ Baseline linear model  
2. **Random Forest Classifier** â†’ Non-linear, handles imbalance with `class_weight="balanced"`  

### ðŸ”¹ Results
| Model                | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|-----------------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression   | ~0.63    | ~0.66   |
| Random Forest         | ~0.72    | ~0.79   |

ðŸ‘‰ Random Forest outperforms Logistic Regression in both accuracy and AUC.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Insights
- **Random Forest** is more reliable for this dataset.  
- **Important features**: `pH`, `Solids`, `Sulfate`, and `Trihalomethanes`.  
- Dataset imbalance still affects performance; future improvements can use **SMOTE** or **Ensemble Methods**.
