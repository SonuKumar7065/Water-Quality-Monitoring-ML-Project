🌊 Water Quality Monitoring – AI/ML Project
📌 Internship Project: Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control
Author: Sonu Kumar

🔎 Project Overview
This project focuses on monitoring water quality using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The system analyzes water quality parameters such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity to predict whether the water is safe (potable) or unsafe for consumption.
The goal is to provide a smart, data-driven solution for environmental monitoring and pollution control.

📊 Dataset
Name: Water Potability Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Water Quality Dataset
#Description:
-Rows: 3,276 samples
-Columns: 9 features + 1 target (Potability)
-Target: Potability (0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe)

⚙️ Requirements
Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
#Main libraries used:
-Python 3.10+
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook:
-Week1_Water_Quality.ipynb
2. Run step by step in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Upload the dataset:
-water_potability.csv
4.cTrain & test the models to check accuracy.

📈 Results
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution plots & correlations between features.
-Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
-Best Accuracy Achieved: ~XX% (update once you run the notebook).
